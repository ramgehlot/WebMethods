webMethods Product Suite : 
▪ Installing and uninstalling products and fixes.
▪ Upgrading products and migrating data.
▪ Creating and dropping databases.
▪ Deploying assets developed in the product suite from one environment
to another.

▪ Software AG Installer is an application that enables you to install, upgrade, and uninstall the webMethods product suite. The installer offers a wizard in both GUI and command line modes that guides you through each of those
activities. In addition, image script can be created and run it on multiple machines to create identical installations.
▪ Update Manager is an application that enables you to install and uninstall fixes to Software AG products.
▪ Deployer is a graphical tool that lets you deploy assets developed in the webMethods product suite from one environment to another.

▪ Integration Server is the webMethods platform’s central run-time component and the primary engine for the execution of integration logic.  
▪ Integration Server Administrator: The Integration Server Administrator is an HTML‐based utility used to administer the webMethods Integration Server. 

▪Both Developer and Designer lets you rapidly construct integration logic with an easy‐to‐use implementation language called the webMethods flow language. Flow 
language provides a set of simple but powerful constructs that you use to specify a sequence of actions (steps) that the Integration Server will execute at run time. 

The webMethods Eclipse Designer  provides:
▪ Service Development perspective for designing and testing flow services.
▪ defining and modifying documents and mapping logic
▪ Testing, debugging and executing services
▪ Creation and configuration of web services
▪ Editing adapter service and notifications (used to connect with external
systems) 

▪ WebMethods Adapters : SAP, and jdbc adapters, only for data communication in databases.

▪ webMethods Broker is a high-speed message router that can use asynchronous publish-subscribe or point-to-point messaging.
▪ WebMethods products publish data to Broker in the form of documents. When a publisher publishes a document to webMethods Broker, webMethods Broker looks up the subscriber list for that document type
and queues the document for the subscribers, each of which retrieves the document and processes it when convenient.

IS Folder and Elements : 
▪ Element: An element is an item that exists in the Navigation panel. Elements include folders, services, specifications, IS document types, triggers, and IS schemas.
▪ Element Names: The fully qualified name of an Integration Server element is composed of two parts: a folder identifier, consisting of the folder path in which the
element resides, and the element name. 
▪ Packages are designed to hold all of the components of a logical unit in an integration solution. package is a container that is used to bundle services and related elements, such as specifications, IS document types, IS schemas, and output templates.
▪ Flow service: A flow service is a service that is written in the webMethods flow language. Any service can be invoked within a flow. Flow services are saved in XML
files on webMethods Integration Server.

▪ Variable: A variable can be a String, String list, String table, document, document list, document reference, document reference list, Object, or Object list.
▪ Document reference: IS document type can be used to build a document reference or document reference list field. Using document reference reduces the time required to create the same fields and maintain better consistency for field names.

▪ Locking: The lock on an element prevents another user from editing that element. This ensures that only one person is working on a particular element at a time, preventing
the loss of changes. There are two types of locks:
▪ User lock
▪ System lock

Flow steps 
 A flow service contains flow steps. 
▪ INVOKE: The Invoke flow step invokes another service.
▪ MAP: The MAP step lets you adjust the contents of the pipeline at any point in a flow service. 
▪ BRANCH: The BRANCH step allows you to conditionally execute a step based on the value of a variable at run time.(switch & if else conditions).
▪ LOOP: The LOOP step repeats a sequence of child steps once for each element in an array that you specify. It is performed on String list, String table, Document list, Object list.
Works on Input array and output array.
▪ REPEAT: The REPEAT step repeatedly executes its child steps up to a maximum number of times that you specify.Works on 2 conditions : Failure , Success.
▪ SEQUENCE: SEQUENCE step is used to build a set of steps that you want to treat as a group. 
▪ EXIT: The EXIT step exits the entire flow service or a single flow step. 
▪ Exit from: Specifies the flow step or service from which you want to exit.
  $parent: Parent flow step, regardless of the type of step.$loop: Nearest parent LOOP or REPEAT step. $flow: Entire flow.
▪ Transformers :  These are inbuilt services which are defined in the IS. Ex : addition transformer, String concat, etc.
▪ Pipeline is the general term used to refer to the data structure in which input and output values are maintained for a flow service. 

▪ Flat File Schema: A flat file schema is the blueprint that contains the instructions for parsing or creating a flat file and is created as a namespace element in the webMethods Integration Server. 
▪ Triggers establish subscriptions to publishable document types and specifies how to process instances of those publishable document types.
