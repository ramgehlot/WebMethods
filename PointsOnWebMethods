webMethods product suite from one environment to another.

▪ Integration Server is the webMethods platform’s central run-time
component and the primary engine for the execution of integration
logic.  

▪Both Developer and Designer lets you rapidly construct integration logic with an
easy‐to‐use implementation language called the webMethods flow language. Flow
language provides a set of simple but powerful constructs that you use to specify a
sequence of actions (steps) that the Integration Server will execute at run time. 

The webMethods Eclipse Designer  provides:
▪ Service Development perspective for designing and testing flow services.
▪ defining and modifying documents and mapping logic
▪ Testing, debugging and executing services
▪ Creation and configuration of web services
▪ Editing adapter service and notifications (used to connect with external
systems) 

▪ WebMethods Adapters : SAP, and jdbc adapters, only for data communication in databases.

▪ webMethods Broker is a high-speed message router that can use
asynchronous publish-subscribe or point-to-point messaging.
▪ WebMethods products publish data to Broker in the form of documents.
When a publisher publishes a document to webMethods Broker,
webMethods Broker looks up the subscriber list for that document type
and queues the document for the subscribers, each of which retrieves the
document and processes it when convenient.
